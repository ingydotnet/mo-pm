=head1 NAME

Mo - Micro Objects. Mo is less.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Less;
    use Mo;
    extends 'Nothing';

    has 'something' => (
        is => 'rw',
        default => sub {
            my $self = shift;
            $self->build_something;
        },
    );

    sub BUILD {
        my $self = shift;
        # enhance your object before it is returned by new()
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

use Mo. Mo is less. Much less.

Moose is huge. Moose led to Mouse led to Moo led to Mo. M is nothing. Mo is
more. Not much.

When Moo is more than you need, drop an 'o' and get some Mo.

=head1 FEATURES

This is what you get. Nothing Mo.

=over

=item C<new> method

Mo provides a C<new> object constructor. You pass it a list of name/value
pairs and it returns a new object.

After object creation, it will call the C<BUILD> method (if present) for all
of its parents and itself.

=item C<extends>

Mo exports the C<extends> keyword, to declare your parent class. C<Mo> itself
is your default parent class, of course.

Mo only supports single inheritance. If you need multiple inheritance or
roles, you should upgrade to Moo.

=item C<has>

Mo exports a C<has> keyword, to generate accessors.

These accessors always support both C<get> and C<set> operations. They allow
the C<default> , C<builder> and C<lazy_build> options. That's it.

    has 'name1';
    has 'name2' => ( default => sub { 'Joe' } );
    has 'name3' => ( builder => 'name_builder' );
    has 'name4' => ( lazy_build => 1 );     # expects sub _build_name4

C<has> takes arguments after the name. Here is what it currently supports:

=over

=item default

Must be a code reference. The object instance is passed in, and it should
return the default value for this attribute. C<default> is always called
lazily. ie It is called when you try to get the value and it does
not(exists()).

=item builder

Must be a method name. This method should return the default value for this
attribute. C<builder> is always called lazily.

=item lazy_build

This is a simple boolean. If set, it will automatically configure the builder
parameter to C<_build_$attributename>, similar to how the Moose option works.
It will however not create any of the other effects of that option, like
creating predicate functions.

=back

Any other arguments are ignored. This lets you switch from Moo to Mo and back,
without having to change all your accessors.

=item C<strict> and C<warnings>

Mo turns on C<use strict> and C<use warnings> for you.

=item Embeddable

Mo is tiny. It is compressed into a single line. You can easily inline it in
your code, should you want to do that. See L<Mo::Inlining> for more
information.
