=head1 NAME

Mo::Inline - Inline Mo and Features into your package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your module:

    package MyModule::Mo;
    # use Mo qw'builder default';
    1;

From the command line:

    > mo-inline lib/MyModule/Mo.pm

or:

    > mo-inline lib/

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mo is so small that you can easily inline it, along with any feature modules.
Mo provides a script called C<mo-inline> that will do it for you.

All you need to do is comment out the line that uses Mo, and run C<mo-inline>
on the file. C<mo-inline> will find such comments and do the inlining for you.
It will also replace any old inlined Mo with the latest version.

What Mo could you possibly want?

=head1 EXAMPLES OF INLINING MO
